.SH NAME
nss_ndb \- BerkeleyDB nsswitch backend for passwd and group data

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B nss_ndb
nsswitch backend is a shared library that enables usage of BerkeleyDB btree
database files as a backend for passwd and group data. It is tuned to be fast
and efficient for large installations (>100,000 entries in passwd & group databases)
and handle users being member of many groups efficiently.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
First make sure there is a symbolic link from /usr/lib/nss_ndb.so.1 to the real location
of the "nss_ndb.so.<version>" library.
.PP
Second step is to populate the databases in the /var/db/nss_ndb/ directory.
.PP
Thirst step is to activate the use of
.B nss_ndb
in the
.R "/etc/nsswitch.conf"
file by adding the
.B "ndb"
keyword on the
.B "passwd"
and
.B "group" lines
.PP
Depending on how
.B nss_ndb
was built support for a configuration file and/or a configuration environment variable
( by default
.B NSS_NDB_CONFIG
)
.I may
(but normally isn't) have been enabled. The environment variable is probably mostly useful
for debugging purposes and uses the same options as the configuration file but are
specified as a comma-separated list of key:val pairs. For details of the configuration file see:
.I nss_ndb.conf(5)
.PP
You can check if
.B nss_ndb
was built with support for a configuration file and/or variable by:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ strings /usr/lib/nss_ndb.so.1 | fgrep nss_ndb.conf
$ strings /usr/lib/nss_ndb.so.1 | fgrep NSS_NDB_CONFIG
.fi
.RE

.SH "DATABASE"
The databases are normally stored in
.R /var/db/nss_ndb
and can be populated via the
.B makendb
tool from text files.
.PP
A more efficient way is to use a sync tool to update the local NDB
databases from a remote source regularily (like a MySQL server, or an AD or LDAP server). An
example sync tool written in Perl is also available as
.B ndbsync
which can be modified for your purposes. If you write your own - make sure you do not forget to
lock the databases before updating them in order to maintain consistency.
